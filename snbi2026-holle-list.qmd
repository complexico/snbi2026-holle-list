abstract: 'Advances in cloud computing, as well as computational tools for extracting text from images, offer an opportunity to scale up the development of digital databases for Indigenous languages. This paper reports on the application of these advances to the digitalisation of old, paper-borne lexical items of over a hundred Indigenous languages in Indonesia; these items are part of the so-called [Holle List (HL)](http://hdl.handle.net/1885/144430). After introducing the (structure of the) HL, the paper underlines the motivation for the [HL digitalisation project](https://portal.sds.ox.ac.uk/projects/Digitised_Holle_List/259172). It then provides an overview of *[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)* as a free cloud-computing platform for executing a series of optical character recognition (OCR) operations on hundreds of scanned pages of the HL, utilising *[pytesseract](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/)*, a Python interface for *[Google’s Tesseract-OCR engine](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)*. Advantages (e.g., computational searchability and manipulability), as well as issues (especially typos and unrecognised characters) in the plain-text OCR outputs, are discussed. In conclusion, the paper highlights the importance of digital technology in conserving Indigenous languages via digital platforms, albeit some unavoidable challenges that require humans (linguistic and manual) intervention.'

## Introduction {#sec-intro}

This paper reports on a digital humanities project of digitalising and curating large volumes of word list, the so-called *Holle List vocabulary*. The Holle List project was initiated in the late 19^th^ century by [Karel Frederik Holle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_Holle), a Dutch colonial administrator. His aim was to gain knowledge about the linguistic situation of the Dutch East Indies of the present-day state of Indonesia. In the first edition of the Holle List [@holle1894], K. F. Holle set up a list of elicitation concepts (i.e., 905 concepts to be exact) given in Dutch [@holle1894, 8-38]. This list was dispersed throughout the Indonesian archipelago. The goal was to collect the corresponding expressions/words of these elicited concepts (from various semantic domains) across over two hundreds indigenous regional language-varieties of Indonesia.

Between 1980 and 1987, W. A. L. Stokhof and his colleagues (viz. Lia Saleh-Bronckhorst and Alma E. Almanar) edited, collated, and published (i) the different versions of the reference/master, elicitation Holle List as well as (ii) the corresponding expressions/words in the indigenous language-varieties into eleven-volume publication series[^1]. These publications are available open access under the Creative Commons License (see @fig-holle-list-search-output in @sec-data-source-acquisition). There are two main parts of these publications. The first one is the volume containing just the reference (or master) Holle List [@holleli1980], comprising the elicitation concepts given in Dutch, English, and Indonesian/Malay together with the index numbers of these concepts (see @fig-matching-master-and-regional-1); this is called *The New Basic List* (hereafter NBL) in Stokhof [-@holleli1980] because Stokhof and colleagues collated three different versions of the Holle List (namely those published in 1894, 1904/1911, and 1931; see @fig-matching-master-and-regional-1). The second part of the Holle List publications is the separate volumes containing the expressions/words of the regional language-varieties and their index numbers (see @fig-matching-master-and-regional-2 for an example from the Enggano language \[Glottocode: [engg1245](http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/engg1245)\]); these index numbers for words in the regional languages correspond to the index numbers of the concepts in the reference Holle List/NBL. It is important to note that there is only one volume of the NBL; the content of the NBL is not repeated in the remaining volumes for the expressions/words in the regional language-varieties, but only the index numbers.

[^1]: See these Holle List publication series [on this page](https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/search?spc.page=1&query=Holle%20Lists&scope=bbe2244b-212d-44b4-b33a-59048fd7e13f).

In the above two-parts publication setup, linguists, who are interested in the Dutch, English, and Indonesian/Malay translations of *a* given word in *a* given regional language, must manually match the index number of that regional word with the same index number in the reference Holle List. Let us use the data snippet in @fig-matching-master-and-regional as an example.

```

To understand what the Enggano word “èbaka” (ID number 3) refers to in Dutch, English, and Indonesian/Malay, one must look up the ID number 3 in the NBL. In this case, “èbaka” in Enggano refers to ‘*gezicht, aangezicht*’ in Dutch, ‘face’ in English, and ‘*muka*, *wajah*’ in Indonesian/Malay. Alternatively, from the perspective of the NBL, linguists could have asked how a given concept is lexicalised in a given language. For example, the concept of ‘*lichaam*’ or ‘body’ in English (and ‘*badan, tubuh*’ in Indonesian) (ID number 1 in the NBL) can be lexicalised by two forms in Enggano, as shown by those given for the ID number 1 in the Enggano list, viz. “kărāhā” and “koedŏdŏkŏ”.

With such paper-based separate setup between elements of words and their translations, one could imagine the amount of manual back-and-forth procedure needed to link the words and their translations. The development of modern data science [@donoho2017] allows us to (i) conceive such setup as disjointed relational data with common keys, namely the index numbers present in both data set (the NBL and the given regional list), and (ii) computationally join them at scale once they are both in computer-readable format [see @wickham2023, Ch. 19, for the description of table-joining and its computational implementation in the R programming language].

In order to tackle the problem of manual matching with a desiderata for computational matching between the NBL and the regional lists, the PDF file containing the NBL table [@holleli1980] has been digitalised into computer-readable, searchable and manipulable database [@rajeg2023] and available online as a webpage at <https://engganolang.github.io/digitised-holle-list/>. The computational joining of the translations in the digitalised NBL data into the regional list data is via the matching keys, viz. the index numbers. This digitalised NBL (in a tab-separated plain-text file) has first been implemented in joining the (also digitalised) regional word list for Enggano with the corresponding Dutch, English, and Indonesian glosses in the master Holle List [@rajeg2023eno; @rajeg2025].

In addition, the motivation to digitalise the reference, master Holle List to envisage scaling-up the computational matching of the other regional Holle Lists once they have been also digitalised. This will enable the collation of these two-parts publications into a digital cross-linguistic lexical database whereby the regional languages are matched with their corresponding Dutch, English, and Indonesian/Malay glosses.

Why digitalise all? Provide large data that open new possibilities for systematic computational historical linguistic analysis in finding relationship between language or diachronic changes of the same language, combining the older data set and the present-day, modern dataset. Other large scale analysis on collexification pattern (i.e., cross-language polysemy).

How to scale-up the digitalisation process for all eleven volumes?

Digitalising the PDF into plain-text file using the *Tesseract* O(ptical) C(haracter) R(ecognition) engine [@smith2007]. The process was run online using cloud computing platform “Google Colaboratory” [@google2026] (see @sec-data-source-processing for further details).

## Methodology {#sec-method}

### Data source acquisition {#sec-data-source-acquisition}

The PDF files for all eleven volumes of the Holle List series are available open access on the Open Research Repository of the Australian National University (ANU) library, under the [“ANU Asia-Pacific Linguistics/Pacific Linguistics Press” collection](https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/collections/bbe2244b-212d-44b4-b33a-59048fd7e13f). The Holle List publications can be looked up using "Holle Lists" as the search term (see @fig-holle-list-search-output).

[![A snippet of the search results for the Holle List publications on the ANU Open Research Repository](img/holle-list-search-results.png){#fig-holle-list-search-output}](https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/search?spc.page=1&query=Holle%20Lists&scope=bbe2244b-212d-44b4-b33a-59048fd7e13f)

The PDF files for every volume was downloaded and uploaded onto the Google Drive of the Holle List project so that they are accessible when processed in the Google Colab coding environment.

### Data processing {#sec-data-source-processing}

-   Create a Jupyter Notebook in the Google Colab for coding and executing the digitalisation of every PDF file of the Holle List.

-   The digitalisation codes are written in the Python programming language. In particular, the Python package *pytesseract* [@hoffstaetter2024] is used to run the Tesseract-OCR engine and functionality.

-   The execution and computation is not run locally on our laptop but on the cloud using the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and the memory provided by Google.

## Results

-   how does the OCR process look like?

## Discussion

-   ...

-   Computational OCR let us obtain results relatively quickly

    -   Pros: non-accented and unformatted (e.g., without underscore) Roman characters are generally well-represented in the OCR output. This means that the effort and time to re-type (or manually type) these well-recognised characters could be effectively reduced, with the focus is only scanning/checking.

    -   Cons: not all characters are recognised correctly (example: )

        -   opportunity: the editing phase of these unrecognised characters can be annotated, tracked and versioned for changes so that we can quantify which character(s) is consistently misrepresented [cf. @fomin2006, 84]

## Conclusion

We need to keep in mind that the regional language data represent the state of the language in the late 19th century and/or early 20th century. Other things to keep in mind is that there can be variation of orthography/spelling between investigators of different
